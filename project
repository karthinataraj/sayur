/1.first we difined a function named as 'count_the'  and give argument 'passage'
2.Inside the function  we first convert the entire passage to lowercase using the lower() and use split() method to split the words
3.We initialize a variable count as a 0 
4.using a for loop , we check if the current word is 'the' and the next word is also 'the' and check its in without 'a' in between
5.if both condition are satisfied then increment the 'count' to next word
6.after finished return final 'the' count




ef count_the(passage):
    words = passage.lower().split()  
    count = 0

    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        if words[i] == 'the' and words[i + 1] == 'the':
            if i == 0 or words[i - 1] != 'a':
                count += 1

    return count
passage ="The cat sat on the mat. The mat was soft and warm. The cat jumped off the mat."

result = count_double_the_in_passage(passage)
print("The number of times 'the the' without 'a' in between: ", result)
